# Star Wars Quotes CRUD App with Node, Express, and MongoDB

This project demonstrates a CRUD application with a Star Wars theme, developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It enables users to keep track of quotes from famous Star Wars characters. Through this project, I showcase my ability to create a reliable and expandable web application utilizing popular server-side technologies.

## How It's Made:

#### Tech used: Node.js, Express, MongoDB

The Star Wars Quotes CRUD App is built using Node.js and Express. with EJS as the templating engine and MongoDB as the database. The application implements RESTful API design principles to enable CRUD operations. The project provides a practice opportunity to develop proficiency in server-side programming with Node.js and Express.

## Optimizations:

This practice project has provided valuable insights into server-side programming with Node.js and Express. In future iterations, I plan to incorporate Mongoose and other advanced features of Express to enhance the application's scalability and performance.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was an opportunity to practice server-side programming with Node.js and Express, and to learn more about the fundamentals of CRUD operations and RESTful API design principles. I gained a deeper understanding of how to structure and organize a Node.js project, and how to work with Express middleware to handle HTTP requests and responses.
